**Backend - A Node.js Task Manager API system**

This Node.js project develops a REST API for managing TODO tasks. The API provides endpoints to Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks, storing the task information in a MongoDB database using the Mongoose framework to streamline communication between the application logic and the database.

Additionally, the project incorporates a JWT-based authentication system and makes use of middleware. While some endpoints are publicly accessible, others require authentication with a registered account.
